## Introduction

If you want to learn the Japanese language (or "Nihongo" as it's called in Japanese) online, you've come to the right place! Our lessons can get you well on your way to learning how to speak, read, and write Nihongo. On this site you will find such things as the Japanese alphabet (including [Hiragana](/japanese-alphabet-hiragana/) and [Katakana](/katakana/)) as well as Kanji (Chinese characters), [vocabulary](/basic-vocabulary-phrases/), [grammar](/basic-grammar/), sentence structure, and [common words and phrases](/useful-phrases/). What sets us apart from other Japanese language courses or tutorials is that we actually teach you [how to conjugate verbs](/verb-conjugation/) and how to build your own sentences - things critical to learning how to speak fluently!

The Japanese language is actually very simple but so unlike English that many English speakers find it difficult to learn. The goal of this 10 free lesson course is to help you study the basics of the language and to teach you how to learn Japanese in a way that is, hopefully, fast and easy to understand.

These public lessons start with basic Japanese and additional beginner lessons as well as intermediate and advanced lessons can be found in our [Members Area](/members/). Our Members Area contains new lessons (on Japanese grammar, kanji, the most useful Japanese phrases, writing hiragana, etc.), audio files, and more! Access is FREE so [register](/register/) now!

**IMPORTANT:** While learning how to speak Japanese, do not rely too heavily on Romanized Japanese or romaji (Japanese written in English letters). It is not used in Japan nor is it widely known in Japan. It is very important to learn Kana (the Japanese alphabets - Hiragana and Katakana) to avoid many issues that can come from using romaji as a crutch.
