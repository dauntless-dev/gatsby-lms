## Using Verb Bases

Now that you know about 30 Japanese verbs and can conjugate them, I'll show you what you can do with those verb bases. You may want to regularly refer to [Lesson 6](/verb-conjugation/) and [Lesson 7](/more-verb-conjugation/) while learning these. The following chart applies to all Japanese verbs unless otherwise noted.
